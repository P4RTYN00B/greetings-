Hey! My name is Finn, but I also go as Broker or sometimes Vincent/Vinny! 
I use They/He pronouns :)
I'm a Subspace/Broker kinnie (I know I am not these characters, but I sometimes have episodes where I truly believe I am them).
I am ND and sometimes agere. 
My current Hyperfixations are as follows: Regretevator, Phighting!, and Object Shows.
My main interest is Phighting, and I can be seen at spawn or the phighting/roblox area. 
I don't mind if you come say hello! In fact, I would appriciate it very much.
I'm okay with booping/kissing/cuddling as long as it is not in a parasocial way! 
The only lable I use is Non-Binary. Otherwise, my sexuality and other orrientations are unlabled.
I do not befriend people I just met, mostly due to social anxiety. However, I am okay with getting to know you!!
Since I struggle with interacting with people, I may accidentally-- or purposely-- ignore you. It is never personal! I may just need a moment to calm down and/or recharge.
If you want to learn more about me and see my DNI/BYI, you should check out my Rentry! Thx for reading. <3
